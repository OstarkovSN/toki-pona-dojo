## Key Files

- `app/core/config.py` — `Settings` class. Reads `../.env`. Add new env vars here. Warns/errors on `"changethis"` secrets in non-local environments.
- `app/models.py` — Single source of truth for all data models (table models + API schemas in one file).
- `app/api/deps.py` — Dependency injection: `SessionDep`, `CurrentUser`, `CurrentSuperuser`. Use these in route handlers.
- `app/api/main.py` — Register new routers here with `api_router.include_router(...)`.

## Adding a New API Endpoint

1. Create `app/api/routes/<domain>.py` with an `APIRouter`.
2. Add models to `app/models.py`.
3. Add CRUD helpers to `app/crud.py` (or a dedicated `app/crud/<domain>.py`).
4. Register in `app/api/main.py`.
5. Generate a migration: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "..."` inside container.
6. Regenerate frontend client: `cd frontend && bun run generate-client`.

## LLM Settings (Phase 3+)

Added to `Settings`:
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` — OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — API key
- `OPENAI_MODEL` — model name (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`)
- `CHAT_FREE_DAILY_LIMIT` — rate limit for anonymous users
- `CHAT_FREE_MAX_TOKENS` — max tokens for free tier
- `TG_BOT_TOKEN` — Telegram bot (optional)
- `LANGFUSE_*` — observability keys

## Non-obvious Patterns

- **`models.py` has both table models and API schemas** in one file (FastAPI template convention). Table models use `table=True`; API schemas (e.g. `UserPublic`, `UserCreate`) do not.
- **`extra="ignore"` in Settings** means unknown `.env` vars are silently ignored. Safe for sharing one `.env` with Docker services.
- **`private` router** is only registered in `local` environment — provides test endpoints not safe for production.
- **Tests need the full stack** — `conftest.py` creates a test DB session. Run via `docker compose exec backend bash scripts/tests-start.sh` to ensure DB availability.
- **Static JSON data** (Phase 2+) lives in `app/data/` and is loaded at module import time (`json.loads(Path(...).read_text())`). No DB table, no migration needed.
- **`cd backend && uv run prek install`** — installs git hooks for entire repo (uses root `.pre-commit-config.yaml`), but must be run from `backend/` since that's where `prek` is installed.
- **Naming gotcha:** The pre-start Python script is named `backend_pre_start.py` (underscores) while the shell wrapper is `prestart.sh` — don't confuse the two.

### Running tests inside the container

The Dockerfile does NOT copy `tests/` — it only copies `app/`, `scripts/`, `pyproject.toml`. Before running tests, sync the tests directory:
```bash
docker compose cp backend/tests backend:/app/backend/tests
docker compose exec backend bash scripts/tests-start.sh
```

Or use `docker compose watch` (which syncs the full `./backend` including `tests/`) instead of `docker compose up -d`.

**Always run the full suite** (`python -m pytest tests/`), not a subset. Module-scoped fixtures like `superuser_token_headers` depend on the `db` session-scoped fixture having run `init_db` — running a subset skips that and causes 404s.

**Avoid stacked `docker cp` runs.** Repeated `docker cp backend/tests backend:/app/` stacks a nested `tests/tests/` inside the container, causing tests to run twice and inflating counts/failures. Check with `docker exec <container> ls /app/tests/` before copying.

### Known pre-existing test issues

- **`test_private.py::test_create_user`** fails intermittently with `UniqueViolation` on `pollo@listo.com` — hardcoded email in the private route test; not related to new tests.
- **`tests/test_pre_start.py`** produces `RuntimeWarning` about module import ordering — pre-existing, not our concern.

### Test authoring gotchas

- **Creating inactive users:** pass `is_active=False` directly to `UserCreate` — `crud.create_user` does not default to active; it follows the model.
- **`parse_cors` with a JSON-array string** (starts with `[`): returns the string as-is for pydantic to parse, not a Python list — the `elif isinstance(v, list | str)` branch handles both.
- **Testing `_check_default_secret` in isolation with `monkeypatch.setenv`:** you must also supply all required `Settings` fields (`PROJECT_NAME`, `POSTGRES_SERVER`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `FIRST_SUPERUSER`, `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`), otherwise `Settings` instantiation fails with a different validation error before reaching the secret check.

### Running tests in a worktree (port conflicts)

When working in a git worktree, starting a new `docker compose up` will fail if another compose stack (e.g. `phase-01-clean-slate`) already holds port 5432. Instead, run tests inside the **already-running** container from the active stack:
```bash
# Skip cp if container was started with docker compose watch (tests/ already mounted)
docker cp backend/tests phase-01-clean-slate-backend-1:/app/backend/tests
docker exec phase-01-clean-slate-backend-1 bash scripts/tests-start.sh
```

Coverage HTML output lands at `/app/backend/htmlcov/index.html` inside the container; retrieve it with:
```bash
docker cp phase-01-clean-slate-backend-1:/app/backend/htmlcov ./htmlcov
```

### Untested / low-coverage areas

- **`app/tests_pre_start.py` and `app/backend_pre_start.py`** are nearly identical; their uncovered branches (exception path, `main()`, `__main__` guard) can be covered with a single shared test pattern applied to both.
- **`app/initial_data.py`** is trivial to cover: call `main()` directly and patch `init_db`, or use `runpy.run_module` for the `__main__` guard.
- **`recover_password_html_content`** (superuser-only, `app/api/routes/login.py`) generates an `HTMLResponse` with password-reset email content — not covered by the default test suite.

### Copying files into a running container

`docker compose cp` requires a matching service name under the current compose project. If the container was started under a different project (e.g. `phase-01-clean-slate-backend-1`), use `docker cp` directly:
```bash
docker cp <src> phase-01-clean-slate-backend-1:/app/backend/<dest>
```
Also note: `docker compose cp` copies a directory snapshot and does NOT pick up newly created files added after the initial copy — always use `docker cp` explicitly for individual new files.

**Whole-directory `docker cp` does NOT reliably overwrite individual existing files.** For single-file updates, use a targeted copy:
```bash
docker cp backend/tests/foo.py <container>:/app/backend/tests/foo.py
```
A prior whole-directory copy can create a `tests/tests/` mirror inside the container. Ruff/mypy lints both; keep them in sync by doing a full overwrite when re-copying the entire tests dir.

### Pre-existing test failures to be aware of

- `tests/tests/api/routes/test_private.py::test_create_user` — fails with `UniqueViolation` on `pollo@listo.com` due to DB isolation from a prior test run. Not caused by new test work.
- `tests/api/routes/test_config.py` — pre-existing mypy errors (missing required `Settings` fields). Do not count these against new test work.

### reset_password endpoint has two separate 400 branches

`app/api/routes/login.py` `reset_password` returns identical 400 "Invalid token" for:
1. A token that fails `verify_password_reset_token()` (bad/expired)
2. A valid token where the decoded email doesn't exist in the DB

This is intentional (prevents user enumeration). Tests must cover both branches independently. For branch 2: generate a real token for an email that was never registered.

### Suppressing ruff/mypy warnings in test helpers

- `ARG001` (unused fixture arg): when a fixture is included only for DB setup side-effects and not used directly, add `# noqa: ARG001`.
- `no-untyped-def` (mypy) on mock helper functions: add annotations `(*args: object, **kwargs: object) -> MagicMock`.

### utils route details

`app/api/routes/utils.py` exposes two endpoints only:
- `GET /utils/health-check/`
- `POST /utils/test-email/` — takes `email_to` as a **query parameter** (not body): `params={"email_to": "..."}`

Any reference to a `password-recovery-html-content` endpoint is stale — it does not exist.

### Mocking `send_email` in tests

Patch the name where it is imported (into the routes module), not where it is defined:
```python
# Correct:
mocker.patch("app.api.routes.utils.send_email", ...)
# Wrong:
mocker.patch("app.utils.send_email", ...)
```

- **`send_email()` passes smtp as a kwarg**: The smtp options dict is passed as `smtp=` keyword argument to `message.send()`, not positional. Assert via `call_args[1]["smtp"]`, not `call_args[0]`.
- **`emails.Message` mock target**: The `Message` class is from the `emails` package (not `email`/`smtplib`). Mock target is `app.utils.emails.Message`.

### Patching pre-start modules

`runpy.run_module('app.tests_pre_start', run_name='__main__')` re-executes in a fresh namespace; patching `app.tests_pre_start.init` has no effect because the `@retry`-decorated function was already bound at first import. Patch `Session` instead, or rely on the live DB being available in the test container.

### Testing Sentry initialization

`app/main.py` initializes Sentry at module import time, not in a lifespan handler — test conditional init logic by patching `settings.SENTRY_DSN` and `settings.ENVIRONMENT` then re-evaluating the `if` branch directly (don't rely on triggering lifespan events).

## Gotchas

### Phase 4.5: Test Coverage

- **`ValidationError` missing from `grade_exercise` except clause** — `ExerciseGradeResponse(**result)` with wrong-typed fields raises pydantic `ValidationError`, not `ValueError`; must catch both in separate branches.
- **`grade_exercise` has two distinct except branches** — parse/type failures → "I couldn't grade this…"; API failures → "The grading service is temporarily unavailable." — test assertions must match the correct branch.
- **Patching stdlib modules requires patch-where-used pattern** — `patch("app.api.routes.chat.asyncio.current_task")` patches the imported name in the module, not `asyncio.current_task` directly.
- **Inner-function imports in test functions keep files clean** — `from datetime import timedelta` inside a test function works fine and avoids polluting top-level imports.
- **`mock_client.chat.completions.create.return_value = iter([])` for empty SSE streaming** — no need to mock streaming protocol; empty iterator is sufficient for 200 response with empty SSE body.
- **Ruff formatter hook reverts partial Edit calls on import lines** — use `Write` to rewrite whole file when adding imports; `Edit` on multi-symbol lines gets reformatted and changes lost.
- **Patching `app.core.config.settings.EMAILS_FROM_EMAIL` for email enabled check** — the property checks `SMTP_HOST` and `EMAILS_FROM_EMAIL`, not `SMTP_USER`; patch the right config key.
- **`_build_word_bank_exercises` is the correct function name** — type string in responses is `"word_bank"`, matching builder name, not data key `"unscramble"`.
- **`random.sample` mocking intercepts both capping and per-builder calls** — filter by `k == 7` to isolate the MAX_EXERCISES cap assertion.
- **`coverage html` with `-k` filter produces harmless "No source for code" warning** — tests still pass and coverage generates correctly despite warning in output.
- **`get_exercises_by_words` mock at `app.api.routes.lessons.get_exercises_by_words`** — cleanly bypasses real data loading while unit's `exercise_types` list still drives which builders run.
- **Unique index on `userprogress.user_id` requires migration run** — model has `unique=True` but `alembic upgrade head` must be run to create actual DB constraint; duplicate FK inserts silently succeed without it.
- **`alembic upgrade head` fails with `UniqueViolation` if duplicates exist** — must `DELETE FROM userprogress WHERE user_id = '...'` before running migration again.
- **`UserProgress.user_id` has FK to `user.id`** — tests inserting `UserProgress` with random UUID fail with `ForeignKeyViolation`; must create real `User` row first.
- **Cleanup order after `IntegrityError` in SQLAlchemy session** — after `db.rollback()`, re-fetch stale ORM objects with `db.get(Model, pk)` before deleting; delete child (UserProgress) before parent (User) to avoid FK cascade errors.
- **`patch("langfuse.Langfuse", ...)` requires langfuse installed** — `unittest.mock.patch` tries to import target module to resolve attribute; if module isn't installed, patch itself raises `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- **`patch("app.data.loader._load_json", ...) + del sys.modules + import` does NOT reliably intercept module-level calls** — fresh `import` inside `with patch(...)` context still reads real files; directly manipulate already-loaded `_WORD_INDEX` instead.
- **`private.py` route needed duplicate-email handling** — bare `session.commit()` raises `IntegrityError` which propagates through `TestClient` as exception (not 500 response); added `try/except IntegrityError → 409` to make it testable.
- **Hardcoded email in `test_create_user` fails on second run** — always use `random_email()` to be idempotent.
- **mypy strict mode requires `-> None` on all test functions** — test functions without return annotations fail mypy; pre-existing `test_units.py` and `test_data_integrity.py` have same issue.
- **`w["word"]` from `dict[str, Any]` has type `Any`** — indexing `dict[str, dict[str, Any]]` with it raises mypy `[index]`; use `str(w["word"])` to satisfy type checker.
- **`app.services.tracing` not mounted via volume** — must be `docker cp`'d into container; `docker compose watch` only mounts `htmlcov/` in phase-01-clean-slate stack.
- **`_configure_langfuse_env` patch target depends on file sync** — patch `app.services.llm._configure_langfuse_env` only after worktree version of `llm.py` (which has the import) is synced to container.
- **Stale `app/services/services/` mirror can appear inside container** — check with `docker exec ... ls /app/backend/app/services/` before running tests.
- **`conftest.py` teardown cleanup order matters** — `delete(UserProgress)` before `delete(User)` to avoid `ForeignKeyViolation` when UserProgress records exist.
- **`test_create_user_duplicate_email_returns_error` with TestClient re-raises IntegrityError** — TestClient re-raises `IntegrityError` (raise_server_exceptions=True default) instead of returning 500; test must catch exception explicitly.
- **Last test alphabetically fails with ForeignKeyViolation on teardown** — conftest cleanup order was wrong (User before UserProgress); correct order in fixture resolves it.
- **[STALE] CLAUDE.md claimed `tests/tests/` mirror existed** — no `tests/tests/` mirror was created; actual issue was conftest cleanup order.

### Phase 4: LangFuse Observability

- **`langfuse>=4.0.0` pulls in full `opentelemetry-*` stack** — transitive deps include opentelemetry-api, -sdk, -exporter-otlp-proto-http, -proto, -semantic-conventions.
- **`uv.lock` lives at repo root, not `backend/`** — `uv add` run from `backend/` updates `../uv.lock`; stage it as `uv.lock` from worktree root.
- **`from langfuse import Langfuse` has stubs; `from langfuse.callback import CallbackHandler` does not** — latter needs `# type: ignore[import-not-found]`.
- **Adding `# type: ignore[import-not-found]` on the `langfuse` import causes mypy `[unused-ignore]`** — only suppress on submodules without stubs; check submodules before adding suppression.
- **`get_langfuse_handler() -> Any` satisfies `no-untyped-call`** — `Any` return type on functions calling LangFuse handles mypy strict mode without needing `# noqa: ANN201`.
- **mypy `--ignore-missing-imports` makes all `type: ignore[import-*]` comments unused** — remove inline `type: ignore[import-not-found]` entirely when using that flag; the flag covers them globally.
- **Formatter hook (ruff) reverts partial `Edit` calls on import lines** — always use `Write` to rewrite entire file when adding new imports with dependent code.
- **All LangFuse-touching functions must `try/except Exception` with `logger.exception(...)`** — graceful degradation pattern; never hard-fail on tracing errors.
- **`check_langfuse_auth()` is startup-time only; other helpers are call-time** — keep auth check as optional lifespan step, never hard dependency.
- **Import test (`uv run python -c "from app.main import app"`) fails in worktrees without `.env`** — environmental issue, not code error; use syntax check + mypy for local verification.
- **Worktree `.env` is gitignored and NOT copied automatically** — manually `cp /home/claude/workdirs/toki-pona-dojo/.env .worktrees/phase-04-langfuse/.env` before running tests.
- **`PROJECT_NAME` and `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` may be empty strings** — inject via env vars: `PROJECT_NAME="toki-pona-dojo" FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD="testpass123" uv run pytest ...`.
- **`patch("langfuse.Langfuse", ...)` patches at module level** — deferred `from langfuse import Langfuse` inside function requires patching `langfuse.Langfuse`, not `app.services.tracing.Langfuse`.
- **`patch.dict("sys.modules", {"langfuse.openai": MagicMock(OpenAI=...)})` for dynamic imports** — patching attributes directly doesn't work for `from langfuse.openai import OpenAI` inside function body.
- **AsyncGenerator[None, None] from `collections.abc` for `@asynccontextmanager` lifespan** — satisfies mypy without issues for functions with no return value.

### Phase 3: LLM Integration

- **slowapi `exempt_when` receives zero arguments** — function signature `exempt_when(request: Request)` raises `TypeError`; use `exempt_when()` with no params.
- **slowapi `exempt_when` runs after FastAPI dependency resolution** — async dependencies execute before the exempt check; for per-request state tracking via ContextVars from async deps, use `asyncio.current_task()` to get the Task object.
- **ContextVars written in threadpool are not visible to caller** — sync `Depends` run via `run_in_threadpool`, writes to ContextVars stay thread-local; make auth-recording deps `async` to run in the event loop and share state with slowapi's `exempt_when`.
- **slowapi limit string is evaluated at decoration time** — `f"{settings.X}/day"` is frozen when the route is defined; use `lambda: f"{settings.X}/day"` to make it dynamic for tests that mutate settings.
- **`docker cp` with non-existent destination requires parent to exist** — `docker cp backend/schemas backend:/app/backend/app/schemas/` requires `/app/backend/app/` to exist; use `docker exec mkdir -p` first or copy individual files.
- **Worktree does not inherit `.env`** — gitignored files don't copy to worktrees; create or manually copy `.env` to worktree root; `backend/app/core/config.py` reads `../.env` relative to its own directory.
- **`OPENAI_API_KEY` vs `OPENAI_API_TOKEN`** — existing `.env` uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` (OpenAI SDK default); Phase 3 config must use the same name; the SDK will NOT auto-pick up a different env var name.
- **`PROJECT_NAME` and `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` are required** — importing `Settings` fails if these are absent/empty; even a quick `python -c` verify will error.
- **`uv sync` creates `.venv` at worktree root** — not inside `backend/`; this matches uv workspace resolution but is easy to assume otherwise.
- **Phase 3 schemas live in `backend/app/schemas/`** — new package created in Phase 3; prior phases had all Pydantic models in `backend/app/models.py`.
- **`list[dict[str, object]]` passes strict mypy** — cleaner than `list[dict[str, Any]]` when annotating recent_errors or error lists; uses `object` instead of importing `Any` from `typing`.
- **Session-scoped `db` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` is `autouse=True`** — any new test subdirectory that doesn't need DB must add its own `conftest.py` overriding this fixture with a no-op mock; otherwise all tests error at collection time.
- **`SYSTEM_PROMPT_CHAT` uses `.format()` placeholders** — e.g. `{unit}`, `{words}`, `{errors}`, `{mode}`; the `{{...}}` double-brace escaping in `SYSTEM_PROMPT_GRADE` is needed because that prompt contains a literal JSON format example that must survive `.format()`.
- **`reusable_oauth2` vs `optional_oauth2` are separate instances** — `reusable_oauth2` has `auto_error=True` (default); new `optional_oauth2` must be a separate instance with `auto_error=False`; reusing the same instance breaks required-auth routes.
- **`OptionalTokenDep` type is `str | None`** — `auto_error=False` allows FastAPI to pass `None` when no token is provided.
- **Container venv doesn't auto-install new deps** — `uv add` inside container updates `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock` but NOT the active `.venv`; use `pip install` directly: `python -m ensurepip && python -m pip install <pkg>`.
- **`docker compose watch` syncs tests automatically; standalone `up` does not** — when using `docker compose up -d`, `docker cp` the app and tests before running test suite.
- **Container working directory matters for test scripts** — `tests-start.sh` must run with `-w /app/backend`; running from `/app` produces "No such file or directory: scripts/tests-start.sh".
- **mypy `--ignore-missing-imports` makes `# type: ignore[import-untyped]` unused** — the `emails` import in `app/utils.py` triggers `[unused-ignore]` when mypy is invoked with that flag; pre-existing template issue.
- **Stale `tests/tests/` mirror from prior `docker cp`** — after repeated whole-directory copies, a nested `tests/tests/` can exist inside container, doubling test counts harmlessly but inflating numbers.
- **Ruff E741 fires on single-letter loop variables** — always use descriptive names like `line` even in short comprehensions to avoid this lint error.
- **`_rate_limit_exceeded_handler` from slowapi causes mypy `arg-type` error** — suppress with `# type: ignore[arg-type]` on `app.add_exception_handler()` call; known false positive.
- **mypy on `client.chat.completions.create(..., stream=True)` returns union** — result is `tuple[str, Any] | ChatCompletionChunk`; suppress with `# type: ignore[union-attr]` on `chunk.choices` access lines.
- **`response.choices[0].message.content` is `str | None`** — must coerce to `str` (e.g. `or ""`) before passing to `json.loads` to satisfy mypy.
- **Post-edit hooks (ruff formatter) revert partial `Edit` calls** — when adding new imports to existing import lines, use `Write` to rewrite the whole file; partial edits get reformatted and changes lost.
- **All required imports for optional auth were already present** — `InvalidTokenError`, `ValidationError`, `jwt`, `OAuth2PasswordBearer` already exist in `app/api/deps.py`.

### Phase 2: Data Layer

- **`uv run python` required** — bare `python`/`python3` not in PATH; all scripts must use `uv run python`.
- **words.json is a flat list**, not a dict keyed by word — loader code must iterate or build an index at load time.
- **Grammar section IDs are strings** (`"basic-sentences"`, `"direct-objects"`, etc.), not numeric indices — downstream code querying by id should use the string id.
- **Exercise word references are validated at data-integrity time** — all words in `"words": [...]` fields must exist in words.json; builders silently skip words missing from JSON without raising errors.
- **Ruff/formatter hook reverts partial Edit calls on import lines** — when adding a new name to an existing `from x import a, b` line, use `Write` to rewrite the entire file instead of `Edit`.
- **`docker cp` requires full directory, not individual files** — `docker cp backend/app/data` copies directory contents; copying to a non-existent path errors; new subdirectories must be copied as a whole.
- **Alembic `--autogenerate` lowercases table names** — `class UserProgress` becomes table `userprogress` (no underscore), per SQLModel convention.
- **Post-edit hook silently drops newly added imports** — when editing multi-symbol imports, always read the file back after hook runs to confirm additions weren't reverted; alphabetical order is how ruff sorts multi-symbol imports.
- **Pipe with `2>&1 | tail -5` masks exit codes** — always test exit codes separately with a plain run, not through pipes.
- **Pytest module-scoped fixtures depend on session setup** — running a test subset skips `init_db`, causing 404s; always run the full suite or ensure fixtures execute first.
- **Repeated `docker cp` of tests stacks `tests/tests/`** — `docker cp backend/tests backend:/app/backend/` copies to `/app/backend/tests` cleanly, but repeated runs from root directory create nested mirror; check with `docker exec <container> ls /app/tests/` before copying.
- **`GRAMMAR.get("sections", [])` returns `Any` type** — when accessing dict[str, Any], assign to a typed local before returning to satisfy mypy `no-any-return`.
- **Ruff B007 fires on unused loop variables** — rename to `_key` when the variable is never used in the loop body.
- **Sample data has 106 vocabulary entries** (validated, comfortably > 85 minimum) and all flashcard categories have >= 3 entries.
- **`set` as a FastAPI query param name works fine** — no shadowing issue (`set: str | None = None` is valid).
- **Exercise builders use lambdas with 3 params** (`words, all_words, filtered`) to cleanly dispatch by type without if/elif chains.
- **Unit 1 exercises use only match + multichoice** types; other exercise types come in later units.
- **SQLModel unique=True on FK fields** — for 1:1 relationships (e.g. one UserProgress per user), add `unique=True` to the FK field; `index=True` alone does not prevent duplicate rows.
- **Exercise builders need KeyError guards** — builders that access dict fields by key on raw JSON entries must use `try/except (KeyError, TypeError)` with `logging.warning` and `continue`; malformed entries must never produce unlogged 500s.
- **Module-level index builds need guards** — bare `{w["key"]: w for w in collection}` dict comprehensions at module level crash app startup on bad data; use a guarded loop that logs and skips entries missing required keys.
- **Unique constraint migration pattern** — when adding `unique=True` to an existing indexed column, generate a new migration that drops the non-unique index and recreates it with `unique=True`; do not edit the original migration.

### Phase 8: Progress Persistence

- **`_merge_progress` in Python must guard non-dict entries** — `recent_errors` and `srs_data` come from unvalidated localStorage; iterate with `isinstance(err, dict)` check + `logger.warning` skip to prevent `AttributeError` crashes.
- **Sync route should wrap `_merge_progress` in try/except** — `_merge_progress` can raise on malformed data; the route handler needs try/except with `session.rollback()` and `logger.exception()` to produce structured 500 errors instead of bare unlogged exceptions.

### Phase 10: Telegram Access Gateway

- **Ruff formatter drops newly added imports** — when editing an existing import line (e.g. adding `col` to `from sqlmodel import Session, select`), the formatter hook reverts it; always use `Write` to rewrite the entire file when the import must survive a hook run.
- **Conditional router registration breaks monkeypatching** — registering `telegram.router` only when `settings.TG_BOT_TOKEN` is truthy at module load time means monkeypatching `settings` in tests has no effect; always register the router unconditionally and let the handler check `is_telegram_enabled()` at request time.
- **`invite_token.used_by` FK requires `session.flush()` before assignment** — setting `invite_token.used_by = db_obj.id` without flushing first raises `ForeignKeyViolation` because the user row isn't in the DB yet; call `session.flush()` after `session.add(db_obj)` to satisfy the FK within the same transaction.
- **Invite-token-gated signup tests need monkeypatched `TG_BOT_TOKEN`** — tests for expired/invalid/used tokens must `monkeypatch.setattr(settings, "TG_BOT_TOKEN", "test_token")` or the gate is inactive and signups succeed unconditionally.
- **Conftest teardown must delete `InviteToken` before `User`** — `invite_token.used_by` FK to `user.id` causes `ForeignKeyViolation` during session teardown if `User` rows are deleted before `InviteToken` rows; order: `delete(InviteToken)` → `delete(AccessRequest)` → `delete(User)`.
- **`TG_SUPERUSER_ID` placeholder string breaks `Settings` validation** — `.env.example` placeholder `your-telegram-user-id-here` is a string but field is `int | None`; tests running against a container with stale `.env` will fail at `Settings()` instantiation; override with `-e TG_SUPERUSER_ID="" -e TG_BOT_TOKEN=""` when running tests.
- **`AccessRequest.created_at.desc()` fails mypy** — mypy sees `created_at` as `datetime`, not an SA column; use `col(AccessRequest.created_at).desc()` (requires `from sqlmodel import col`).
- **`-> dict` return type fails mypy strict mode** — all route handlers returning plain dicts must use `-> dict[str, Any]` or `-> dict[str, bool]`; bare `dict` triggers `[type-arg]` error.

### Phase 10: Backend Test Infrastructure

- **`tests/tests/` mirror runs stale copies** — when `docker cp backend/tests backend:/app/backend/tests` is used, a nested `tests/tests/` mirror appears. Fixed files must be copied to BOTH `tests/<path>` and `tests/tests/<path>` explicitly; whole-directory re-copy doesn't reliably overwrite individual files.
- **Actual API paths for lessons and progress:**
  - `GET /api/v1/lessons/units` — full skill tree, returns 10 units
  - `GET /api/v1/lessons/units/{unit_id}/lessons/{lesson_id}` — lesson exercises (lesson_id is not validated, just echoed back)
  - `GET/PUT /api/v1/progress/me` — get/update authenticated user's progress
  - `POST /api/v1/progress/sync` — merge localStorage progress (max/union strategy)
- **`lesson_id` path param is not validated** — the lesson endpoint accepts any integer; only `unit_id` is checked against the data. Tests should use `lesson_id=1` as a safe placeholder.
- **Signup returns 400 when `TG_BOT_TOKEN` is set** — invite gate is active; `test_register_user` must `patch.object(settings, "TG_BOT_TOKEN", "")` to bypass the gate. Same for `test_register_user_already_exists_error`.
- **`_create_valid_token()` in `test_invite_flow.py` left AR with `telegram_user_id=42` as "approved"** — `handle_start` for the same user 42 later found the "approved" record and skipped creating a new pending one, causing `test_handle_start_new_user` to fail. Fix: use randomized user IDs in `_create_valid_token` and `_create_expired_token`, and explicitly clean up created records.
- **Rate limiter (5/minute) for `/validate-token` exhausted by mirrored tests** — both `tests/` and `tests/tests/` call validate-token multiple times in sequence, exceeding the per-IP limit. Fix: add `autouse=True` fixture that calls `limiter._storage.reset()` before each test in `test_invite_flow.py`. The storage is `limits.storage.memory.MemoryStorage` which has a `reset()` method.
- **`test_sync_progress_empty_server` uses superuser progress which accumulates across test runs** — the mirror's `test_sync_progress_merge_union` sets superuser `completed_units=[1,2,3]` before the mirror's `test_sync_progress_empty_server` runs sync with `[1,2]`, getting `[1,2,3]` back (union). Fix: explicitly delete the superuser's `UserProgress` row before the "empty server" test, using `db` session fixture.
- **Langfuse not installed in the test container** — `patch("langfuse.Langfuse", ...)` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError`. Fix: stub `sys.modules["langfuse"]` with `MagicMock()` at module load time if `langfuse` is not installed. Needs to be done before the patch context manager runs.
- **`test_data_integrity.py` path breaks in `tests/tests/` mirror** — `Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent / "app" / "data"` resolves correctly from `tests/data/` but resolves to `tests/app/data` from `tests/tests/data/`. Fix: use a helper that walks up parents looking for a directory where `app/data` exists.
- **conftest `db` fixture is `session`-scoped** — a single DB session is shared across all tests. Tests that mutate shared resources (superuser's UserProgress, AccessRequests) must clean up explicitly to avoid cross-test interference.
